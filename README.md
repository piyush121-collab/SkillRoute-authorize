# My Project

## Overview
This project consists of a backend and a frontend application. The backend is responsible for handling server-side logic, while the frontend will manage the user interface.

## Project Structure
```

```

## Backend
### `backend/index.js`
This file serves as the entry point for the backend application. It initializes the server, sets up middleware, and defines routes for handling requests.

### `backend/chat.js`
This file contains the logic for chat functionality. It includes functions for sending and receiving messages, managing chat rooms, and handling user connections.

## Frontend
The `frontend` folder is intended for the frontend application but currently does not contain any files.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `my-project` directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies for the backend:
   ```
   cd backend
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the backend server:
   ```
   node index.js
   ```

## Usage Guidelines
- Access the backend API at `http://localhost:PORT` (replace PORT with the actual port number).
- The frontend will be developed in the `frontend` folder.
